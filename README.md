This is a program that lets you test three different Parrondos Paradox strategies. Parrondos Paradox is a game theory paradox that states that there exists two losing games 
such that, if you play them in alternating orders, you will end up with a winning record. The two games are as follows. In game a, you have a .5 - epsilon chance to win. 
In the second game, if the amount of money you have is divisible by three, you have a .1-epsilon chance to win; otherwise, you have a .75-epsilon chance to win.
 If you were to play only one of these games, you would end up losing.

I include two other strategies beyond alternating games. The second strategy picks a random game to play. The third plays game a twice, then game b twice, etc. 
In all of these strategies, we expect to have a winning rate by the end, provided we play enough games.
